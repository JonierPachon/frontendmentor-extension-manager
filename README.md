This is my solution to the [Browser Extension Manager UI challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/browser-extension-manager-ui-yNZnOfsMAp). The goal was to build a responsive, interactive extension manager using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that matches the provided design as closely as possible.

## 💡 What I Learned

This challenge was truly engaging and helped me level up my frontend development skills in several ways:

- 📦 I learned how to load and work with **JSON data** directly in the browser without a backend server.
- 🌓 I implemented a **dark/light mode toggle** that responds to user preferences, improving accessibility and user experience.
- 📍 I improved my understanding of **event delegation** using `addEventListener`, which made my code more scalable and maintainable.
- 💬 I gained experience in clearly **communicating button actions** to users by updating the interface dynamically.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5 semantic elements
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
